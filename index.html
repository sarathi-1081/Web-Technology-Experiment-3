        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, was founded with the
          noble vision to raise professionals and leaders of high academic
          calibre and unblemished character, nurtured with a strong motivation
          and commitment to serve humanity. The institution is the fulfillment
          of the vision of its founders Late Dr. D. G. S. Dhinakaran and the
          present Chancellor Dr. Paul Dhinakaran. Established in 1986 as an
          Engineering College, it was granted an autonomous status in 1999 and
          declared Deemed-to-be University by the University Grants Commission
          (UGC) in recognition of its academic excellence by the Ministry of
          Human Resources Development under section 3 of the UGC Act, 1956 vide
          notification no 9-3-2000-U3 dated 23.6.2004 of the Government of
          India. Accredited by NAAC, the institution offers a wide array of
          Bachelors, Masters and Doctoral Degree programmes in various branches
          of Engineering, Biotechnology, Food processing and Agricultural
          Sciences. From a humble beginning of 180 students, the institution has
          rapidly grown to 8491 students and 452 faculty representing 18
          academic departments

          <h2>Campus Life</h2>
          <p>
            Karunya is a residential institution, hosts diverse, creative and
            talented people from the state of India and from different parts of
            the world with a safe, secure environment and a plethora of student
            activities, the campus life at Karunya is vibrant, colourful,
            entertaining and engaging. When you go away to college for the first
            time, you want to make sure you're prepared. You may be living on
            your own for the first time, so there could be some items you
            wouldn't normally consider taking because someone at home, such as a
            parent or guardian, usually takes care of them for you. Consult your
            college acceptance literature for any specific items your college
            asks you to bring. If you're able, touch base with your roommate
            prior to school to make sure you're not bringing duplicates of large
            items such as TVs, couches or refrigerators. Having double will just
            take up space and make for a less comfortable environment.

          <h2>Drone Technology for Agricultural Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Drones can help farmers to optimize the use of inputs (seed,
            fertilizers, water), to react more quickly to threats (weeds, pests,
            fungi), to save time crop scouting (validate treatment/actions
            taken), to improve variable-rate prescriptions in real time and
            estimate yield from a field. As of today, drones cannot communicate
            directly with agricultural equipment. Drones fly over the field and
            take high resolution pictures. The data gathered is directly sent to
            the cloud/software and made available to the customer. Thanks to
            this data, the user can select the information wanted from the
            images and make different prescription maps depending on the
            operation the farmer wants to perform on the field. The maps can
            then be uploaded on the farm equipment which will adjust the amount
            of inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides) that would need to be
            applied in the field accordingly.
